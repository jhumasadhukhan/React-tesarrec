24th Jul - 7th Aug 
-----------------
1. SolverAnalysis to read *.json files and write *.json files to disk 
2. upgrade strucutire of *json files to includes solutions, RMSE, Speed
3. Create a Model class to represent the json file WHY - keep correctness together
4. Convert a/b/c/d/t to y1,y2,y3,y4,t,
5. Add indenpendnte x1,x2,x3,x4
6. SolverAnalysis Grapher class to create a scatter from output jsons

Clarify
========
    change to pqrs
    
    D) Separate Math code from graph code
    E) replace array use with x_0, y_0 syntax
    F) Cover at least the mathmodule



Themes
========
    Alternative chart libs
    get a better heat map package
    when all values are 0 the colours are still there so find a better normalisation
    find a heatmap normalisation
    Write code to convert $data/xls/* xls to $data/json/*
    responsive designs
    1 heatmap per file
    reformat Folders
    use only one heatmap form perhaps
