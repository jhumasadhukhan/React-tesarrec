            Evaluating technical feasibility and life cycle sustainability of
            these systems;

      <h3>
      One such group of technologies are electrochemical technologies
      </h3>
      <p>
      Bio-based electrochemical technologies are becoming popular due to their non-toxic non-chemical way of transforming waste into electricity generation or fuel or chemical synthesis from carbon dioxide reuse, depending on the mode of operation. Their main modes of operation include microbial fuel cells (MFC) and microbial electrosynthesis systems (MES).
