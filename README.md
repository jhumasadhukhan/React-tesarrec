## User Guidelines

This is a webpage that was built in alliance with the University Of Surrey CES Department. It contains Microbial Fuel Cell calculations and graphs. It containes dynamic simulations involving single ODEs and linear coupled ODEs. Fundamentally this site allowed browser based modelling of a variety of scientific models including and not limited to models 

1. Algebraic
2. Linear ODE
3. ODE Systems
4. Differtial + Algebraic systems

Tool for techno-Economic and Sustainability Analysis of Resource Recovery Engineering solutions for Circular economy
New gen engineered technologies and solutions for sustainability and circular economy
We develop computer software for use in:
Evaluation of organic compounds synthesized by carbon dioxide capture by organic degradation in wastewater;
Evaluating the dynamic performance of these systems;
Evaluating technical feasibility and life cycle sustainability of these systems;
One such group of technologies are electrochemical technologies
Bio-based electrochemical technologies are becoming popular due to their non-toxic non-chemical way of transforming waste into electricity generation or fuel or chemical synthesis from carbon dioxide reuse, depending on the mode of operation. Their main modes of operation include microbial fuel cells (MFC) and microbial electrosynthesis systems (MES).

## Development Guidelines 

To test a single test do 
npm run test LinearCoupledDiffEqns

### Application Design Notes

Uses container vs component folder structure
Container= statefull 
Component= stateless
group js css test files together

### SDLC = Software Development Life Cycle
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
#### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**
If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.
You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

#### How to check for test coverage
npm run test= npm test (to test all files)
npm test -- --coverage (for files changed since last commit)
npm test -- --coverage --watchAll=false (for all files )

#### How to deploy and run on Firebase
npm run build
then follow https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting

#### for future updates run:
npm run build
firebase deploy

#### How to deploy and run locally
npm install (to install 3rd party packages)
npm start

#### Deployment to Firebase
Create a file called src/firebasekey.js with the following contents
const FIREBASE_KEY = "<Put Your Key here from Google Firebase>"
export default FIREBASE_KEY
